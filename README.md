# Bus Reservation System (Python)

This is a console-based Bus Reservation System developed using Python. It is an upgraded version of my C++ project with improved functionality and cleaner structure. The system allows users to view available buses, book seats, enter user details, calculate fare, and confirm bookings.

## Features

- View available buses with details
- Book multiple seats with user information
- Fare calculation
- Route display based on selected bus
- Seat availability and confirmation system
- Console-based interface with clear prompts

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run the following command in terminal:

```bash
python BusReservation.py
```
